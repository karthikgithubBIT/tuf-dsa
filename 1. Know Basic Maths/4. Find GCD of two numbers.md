# Brute Force Approach
Algorithm
Intuition:
The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. We iterate through all numbers from 1 up to the minimum of the two input numbers, checking if each number is a common factor of both input numbers.

If a number is a common factor, we update our gcd variable to that number. This process continues until we have iterated through all possible common factors. Finally, we return the gcd variable, which will hold the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Initialise a variable gcd to 1. This variable will store the greatest common divisor of the input numbers n1 and n2.

Step 2: Iterate from 1 to the minimum of n1 and n2.

We start from 1 because the GCD of any two numbers is at least 1, and it cannot be greater than the smaller of the two numbers.
Step 3: At each iteration, if i is a common factor of both n1 and n2 update the gcd variable to i. We keep updating gcd as long as we find common factors.

Step 4: After the iteration, the gcd variable will store the greatest common divisor of n1 and n2. Return this value as the output of the function.

# Code
```js
public class Main {
    public static int findGcd(int n1, int n2) {
        // Initialize gcd to 1
        int gcd = 1;

        // Iterate from 1 up to
        // the minimum of n1 and n2
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.min(n1, n2); i++) {
            // Check if i is a common
            // factor of both n1 and n2
            if (n1 % i == 0 && n2 % i == 0) {
                // Update gcd to the
                // current common factor i
                gcd = i;
            }
        }

        // Return the greatest
        // common divisor (gcd)
        return gcd;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 20, n2 = 15;

        // Find the GCD of n1 and n2
        int gcd = findGcd(n1, n2);

        System.out.println("GCD of " + n1 + " and " + n2 + " is: " + gcd);
    }
}                            
```
                            
# Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(min(N1, N2)) where N1 and N2 is the input number. The algorithm iterates from 1 to the minimum of N1 and N2 and each iteration checks whether both the numbers are divisible by the current number (constant time operations).

Space Complexity: O(1)as the space complexity remains constant and independent of the input size. Only a fixed amount of memory is required to store the integer variables.

# Better Approach
 Algorithm
Intuition:
We can optimise the time complexity of the previous approach. In the worst case, the loop iterates from 1 up to the minimum of N1 and N2. This could potentially result in a large number of iterations, especially when one input number is significantly larger than the other.

If we iterate from the minimum of N1 and N2 down to 1, we reduce the number of iterations because we start from the potentially largest common factor and work downwards.

The time complexity of this approach remains O(min(N1, N2)) but in practice, it will execute fewer iterations on average.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Iterate from the minimum of n1 and n2 because the greatest common divisor of two numbers cannot exceed the smaller number.

Step 2: For each i in the iteration, we check if it is a common factor of both n1 and n2.

If a common factor i is found, we return it as the gcd as we are iterating from the largest potential gcd to 1, the first common factor we encounter will be the greatest common divisor.
Step 3: If the loop completes without finding any common factors we return 1. This is because 1 is always a divisor of any number any number hence is also the GCD of any pair of numbers where no other common factors exist.

# Code

```js
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static int findGcd(int n1, int n2) {
        // Iterate from the minimum of
        // n1 and n2 down to 1
        // Start from the minimum of n1 and n2
        // because the GCD cannot
        // exceed the smaller number
        
        for (int i = Math.min(n1, n2); i > 0; i--) {
            // Check if i is a common
            // factor of both n1 and n2
            if (n1 % i == 0 && n2 % i == 0) {
                // If i is a common factor,
                // return it as the GCD
                return i;
            }
        }
        // If no common factors are found,
        // return 1 (as 1 is always a
        // divisor of any number)
        return 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 20, n2 = 15;
        
        // Find the GCD of n1 and n2
        int gcd = findGcd(n1, n2);

        System.out.println("GCD of " + n1 + " and " + n2 + " is: " + gcd);
    }
}
```

# Optimal Approach
Algorithm
                            
Euclidean Algorithm:

The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD)
of two numbers. It operates on the principle that the GCD of two numbers remains
the same even if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.

To find the GCD of n1 and n2 where n1 > n2:
1. Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of them becomes 0.
2. Once one becomes 0, the other is the GCD of the original numbers.

```js
Example:
n1 = 20, n2 = 15

gcd(20, 15) = gcd(20 - 15, 15) = gcd(5, 15)
gcd(5, 15)  = gcd(15 - 5, 5)  = gcd(10, 5)
gcd(10, 5)  = gcd(10 - 5, 5) = gcd(5, 5)
gcd(5, 5)   = gcd(5 - 5, 5)  = gcd(0, 5)
```

Hence, return 5 as the GCD.
    
# Code

public class Main {
    // Continue loop as long as both
    // a and b are greater than 0
    public static int findGcd(int a, int b) {
        while(a > 0 && b > 0) {
            // If a is greater than b,
            // subtract b from a and update a
            if(a > b) {
                // Update a to the remainder
                // of a divided by b
                a = a % b;
            }
            // If b is greater than or equal
            // to a, subtract a from b and update b
            else {
                // Update b to the remainder
                // of b divided by a
                b = b % a;
            }
        }
        // Check if a becomes 0,
        // if so, return b as the GCD
        if(a == 0) {
            return b;
        }
        // If a is not 0,
        // return a as the GCD
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 20, n2 = 15;

        // Find the GCD of n1 and n2
        int gcd = findGcd(n1, n2);

        System.out.println("GCD of " + n1 + " and " + n2 + " is: " + gcd);
    }
}
```
