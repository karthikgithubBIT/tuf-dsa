# Reverse Digits of A Number

# Problem Statement: Given an integer N return the reverse of the given number.
Note: If a number has trailing zeros, then its reverse will not include them. For e.g , reverse of 10400 will be 401 instead of 00401.

```js
Input: N = 12345
Output:54321
Explanation: The reverse of 12345 is 54321.

Input: N = 7789                
Output: 9877
Explanation: The reverse of number 7789 is 9877.
```

# Approach
Algorithm
We know that extracting digits of a number can be done by repeatedly taking modulo 10 and dividing by 10. Now, instead of just extracting digits, if we build a new number by appending these digits in reverse order, we effectively reverse the number. Each new digit becomes the least significant digit of the reversed number by multiplying the current reversed value by 10 before adding the digit.
Initialize a variable to store the reversed number as 0.
Loop while the original number is greater than 0.
Extract the last digit by performing modulo 10.
Multiply the reversed number by 10 and add the extracted digit.
Remove the last digit from the original number using integer division by 10.
Continue this process until the original number becomes 0.
Return the reversed number.

```js
import.java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    // Function to reverse digits of a number
    public int reverseNumber(int n) {
        // Variable to store reversed number
        int revNum = 0;

        // Loop until all digits are processed
        while (n > 0) {
            // Get the last digit
            int lastDigit = n % 10;

            // Append it to the reversed number
            revNum = revNum * 10 + lastDigit;

            // Remove the last digit from n
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Return the reversed number
        return revNum;
    }
}

// Driver code
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution obj = new Solution();
        int num = 12345;
        System.out.println(obj.reverseNumber(num));  // Output: 54321
    }
}
```

# Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(log₁₀N),The number of iterations in the loop depends on the number of digits in the number N. Since each digit is processed once using constant time operations (modulo, division, multiplication, and addition), the total time taken is proportional to the number of digits, which is log₁₀N.

Space Complexity: O(1),Only a constant number of variables are used regardless of the size of the input number.
