# Check if a number is Armstrong Number or not

# Problem Statement:Given an integer N, return true it is an Armstrong number otherwise return false.

An Amrstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Examples
```js
Example 1:
Input:N = 153
Output:True
Explanation: 1^3+5^3+3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
                                        
Example 2:
Input:N = 371                
Output: True
Explanation: 3^3+7^3+1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371
```
            
# Approach
Algorithm
Calculate the number of digits in the input number and store it in k.
Initialise a variable sum to 0. This variable will store the sum of each digit raised to the power of number of digits in number.
Make a copy of the original number to store it in a temporary variable.
Run a while loop with the condition n>0 and at each iteration:
Get the last digit of n by using the modulus operator % with 10 and store it in a temporary variable ld.
Add the digit ld raised to the power of k of the sum.
Update n by integer division with 10 effectively removing the last digit.
After the loop, check if the original input number is equal to the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.
If they are equal, return true indicating the number is an Armstrong number.
If they are not equal, return false indicating that the number is not an Armstrong number.

# Code
```js
public class ArmstrongChecker {

    // Static method to check if a number is an Armstrong number
    public static boolean isArmstrong(int num) {
        int k = String.valueOf(num).length(); // Get number of digits
        int sum = 0;
        int n = num;

        while (n > 0) {
            int ld = n % 10;             // Last digit
            sum += Math.pow(ld, k);      // Add ld^k
            n /= 10;                     // Remove digit
        }

        return sum == num;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 153;

        // Use class method to check
        if (isArmstrong(number)) {
            System.out.println(number + " is an Armstrong number.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is not an Armstrong number.");
        }
    }
}
```

# Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(log10N + 1) where N is the input number. The time complexity is determined by the number of digits in the input integer N. In the worst case when N is a multiple of 10 the number of digits in N is log10 N + 1.

Space Complexity: O(1) as only a constant amount of additional memory for the reversed number regardless of size of the input number.
